# Technical Architectural Document
## Functions requirements
Users needs to be able to vote and reset votes on the Voting App application and Voting App needs to be highly available.

## Non-functionnal Needs
| Element | Value | Comments |
| ------- | ------ | ------------ |
| Provider | Azure | - Value and cost-effectiveness <br> - Compatibility <br> - Security |
| Service | AKS | - Auto upgrades <br> - Patching <br> - Self-healing |
| Gateway | Ingress | Integrated in AKS |
| BDD | Redis | - Good performance, low latency <br> - Flexible data structures <br> - Open Source |
| Application | VotingApp | Required and needs to be able to scale horizontally and have a single domain name |

## Architecture Decisions
| Topic | Content |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Architecture Decision | Use of a Gateway |
| Problem | What Gateway to use? |
| Hypothesis | Use of Application Gateway |
| Alternatives | A: Use of Azure Application Gateway <br> B: Use of Ingress in Kubernetes |
| Decision | Option B is selected |
| Reasoning | 1- Easier potential transition to another public cloud provider <br> 2- Less dependant on Azure specific infrastructure and services |
| Implication | Generation and incorporation of the TLS certificate within Kubernetes |
