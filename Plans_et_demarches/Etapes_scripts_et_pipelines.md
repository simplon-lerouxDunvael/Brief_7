## Etapes scripts et Pipelines

## 1. Creation of a resource group

```bash
az group create --location francecentral --name b7duna
```

<!-- ## 2. Creation of a storage account (standard GRS)

```bash
az storage account create --name b7dstoracc --resource-group b7duna --sku Standard_GRS
``` -->

## 3. Creation of the AKS Cluster (with SSH keys generated)

```bash
az aks create -g b7duna -n AKSClusterDuna --enable-managed-identity --node-count 2 --enable-addons monitoring --enable-msi-auth-for-monitoring  --generate-ssh-keys
```

## 4. Connecting the AKS Cluster and Azure

```bash
az aks get-credentials --resource-group b7duna --name AKSClusterDuna
```

## 5. Creation of the redis secret

```bash
kubectl create secret generic redis-secret-duna --from-literal=username=devuser --from-literal=password=password_redis_154
```

<!-- ## 6. Creation of the storage account secret

```bash
kubectl create secret generic storage-secret --from-literal=azurestorageaccountname=b7dstoracc --from-literal=azurestorageaccountkey=Ha/rrRrMwoLotpOK1wT5a1dphjPgfa0z9NZjf7W/1veO6nhHgNtzvjFyIK+y1oBy+I92/y73CPVp+AStu1jQQQ==
``` -->

## 7. Connecting to Azure DevOps Pipelines

First I went to Azure DevOps, created a project and clicked on Pipelines : <https://dev.azure.com/dlerouxext/b7duna/_build>  
Then I added a service connection (Project settings > service connections > add > kubernetes).

![service_connection2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210520992-0536c68a-17b6-4b8a-91e4-2bccb2159e75.png)

## 8. Creation of a test pipeline

I created a new pipeline and provided its location (Github.yaml) and the repository (Brief_7). Then I chose a starter template and used the assistant to add a Kubectl task.  
Finally I saved it and ran it.

![pipeline_job_run](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210521068-ec3cc98c-e2ab-46a7-9d46-3cadd39a3c37.png)

## 9. Checks and tests

In order to understand how the pipeline works and the path used on the pipeline's environment vm, I used the commands ```pwd``` and ```ls -la``` on my pipeline script :

![pipeline_job_run2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210543908-3f4670ec-8fdb-444f-acb7-e728a63d2d48.png)

It allowed me to know which path I needed to put to refer the .yaml file to use in the pipeline.

## 10. Error messages

I received an error at the end of the job. It seems that Azure does not have the rights to create a persistent volume and the PV claim.

![Error_pipeline](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210544375-1f1e042e-a659-4c1f-941b-49a9ce07d471.png)

On the Azure CLI I searched the service account default used by Azure to run the pipeline with the following command :

```bash
kubectl get serviceaccounts/default
```

Alfred tried to bind an admin role he created to the Azure service account Default to see if we could get admin rights on the Kubernetes cluster. Sadly it did not work.

![Error_pipeline2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210545569-b0ce0e74-e461-4407-b3fc-69c6ecfbaad5.png)

## 11. Trying to find a solution

I recreated my Kubernetes Service Connection and checked "Use cluster admin credentials". As Alfred changed the credentials previously, when I reran my pipeline I had no rights issue.

Then I focused on the PV and PVC issue.

I created a container in my storage account in order to be able to use my fileshare for the PV and PVC.

My PV displayed but was not mounted thus my redis container could not be created.

To understand the errors I had I checked the events :

```bash
kubectl get events
```

```bash
kubectl get events --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp'
```

```bash
kubectl get events --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp' -w
```

## 12. Updating the voting app on the script

I changed the previous version of the voting app with the new one : simplonasa/azure_voting_app:v1.0.11 and my container for the Voting app was successfully created.
It then displayed in CrashLoopBackOff because redis was not created but now I just needed to find a solution for redis and the PV/PVC for everything to work properly.

## 13. Creation of a storage share for the storage account

I checked if I had a storage share for my storage account with the command :

```bash
az storage share list --account-name b7dstoracc --account-key Ha/rrRrMwoLotpOK1wT5a1dphjPgfa0z9NZjf7W/1veO6nhHgNtzvjFyIK+y1oBy+I92/y73CPVp+AStu1jQQQ==
```

I did not, so I created a storage share directly on my storage account.

```bash
az storage share create --account-name b7dstoracc --name b7d-redis-fileshare --account-key Ha/rrRrMwoLotpOK1wT5a1dphjPgfa0z9NZjf7W/1veO6nhHgNtzvjFyIK+y1oBy+I92/y73CPVp+AStu1jQQQ==
```

Then I verified that it had been successfully created.

![storage-share_check](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210567347-d9933eb0-4cf3-4753-a70e-1ed4170ecbf9.png)

Then I check my pods and services :
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services

As everything was running perfectly, I used the IP address to connect to the Voting App. It worked fine. Then I deleted the redis pod ```kubectl delete pod redis-service``` and typed ```kubcetl get pods```. The redis service was automatically renewed.  
Finally, I refreshed the voting app page and found out that the votes count had not been reset. All the containers were working and the persistent volume as well.

## 14. Remove the PV

As Kubernetes automatically creates a PV when a PVC is created, I removed the PV from my script and decided to start again without creating the storage account, the storage share to verify if Kubernetes would do everything automatically. Then I ran the pipeline.

When I searched for the PVC and the pods with kubectl commands on Azure CLI, their status showed that it did not work properly.

![not_working_AGAIN](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210743380-128d1882-c8ad-45f6-a2c4-4f159585c20e.png)

After some researches _(and screechs)_, I modified the ```volumes``` part on the redis container with the persistentVolumeClaim and removed the references to the PV. I updated it as well in the ```volumeMounts``` part. Finally, I relaunched the pipeline and the job ran successfully.

## 15. Delete everything and start again

I decided to delete my resource groups to try once again from scratch and check if it also worked when Alfred and Bryan weren't watching _(just in case the code gets pressured to work when they are present, we never know)_.

![pipeline_working](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210748762-a67a9983-bf18-480d-af1b-de5107fcc2b8.png)

## 16. Scheduling

[Scheduling a pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/scheduled-triggers?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml)

In order to update the Voting app with its last version, I scheduled the pipeline so it would ran every hour on the hour.

![scheduling](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210753304-56bbd627-4139-4193-8afa-b20696251a79.png)

Then I verified that the pipeline job was a success.

![scheduling_pipeline_success](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210757983-4f4958a2-c718-46ec-9083-f622e9f4483f.png)

## 17. Add Ingress

As the scheduling was working, I decided to install Ingress to be able to access to the voting app from an url http I chose (and that i would later link to my dns record).  

I removed the Load balancer in my azure-vote.yaml file in order to put ClusterIP so that ingress can provide an IP address to use for my DNS record.  

![clusterIP_for_ingress](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210793328-a1052a6d-c03c-4dc7-bc24-0331170b7aac.png)

![no_tls](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210793423-5cf4b0af-93ea-4a51-b412-6439adef0f04.png)

I removed the TLS parts, the host and the TLS annotations in my ingress.yaml file. Then I applied it ```kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml``` and checked it with ```kubectl get ingress```.

But I had no IP address. So I installed everything that was necessary for ingress with the following command :

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.4.0/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
```

After this step, ingress finally had an IP address. Then I created a "A" DNS record with the ingress IP address. I checked ingress and it now displayed with : smoothie.simplon-duna.space.
Finally I connected to the Voting app using smoothie.simplon-duna.space and it worked.

![dns_records](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210812132-630cc498-504f-4b29-b725-66d8f442ef4f.png)

## 18. Install Cert-manager and Jetstack (for gandi)

[Jetstack](https://github.com/bwolf/cert-manager-webhook-gandi)

Since my ingress was working and i could connect in http to my voting app, I installed Jetstack and created a repository.

```bash
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io
```

Then, I installed cert-manager ([To check cert-manager last version to install](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/supported-releases/)).

```bash
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --namespace cert-manager --create-namespace --set installCRDs=true --version v1.10.1 --set 'extraArgs={--dns01-recursive-nameservers=8.8.8.8:53\,1.1.1.1:53}'
```

<img width="1820" alt="Cert_manager" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210761309-393e496c-ff14-41e2-b02a-7b65fb7baeb7.png">

## 19. Gandi secret

After cert-manager was installed, i created a secret for Gandi with the token from my gandi dns.  
_To check the token > settings from account > account and security > security._

```bash
kubectl create secret generic gandi-credentials --namespace cert-manager --from-literal=api-token='yRAidcmI81TWiAX1CaYNTJiN'
```

![gandi-secret](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210763575-22af59d1-812b-43fa-9017-9b9ff20b7b15.png)

## 20. Install cert-manager webhook for gandi

Then i installed cert-manager-webhook for gandi.

```bash
helm install cert-manager-webhook-gandi --repo https://bwolf.github.io/cert-manager-webhook-gandi --version v0.2.0 --namespace cert-manager --set features.apiPriorityAndFairness=true  --set logLevel=6 --generate-name
```

## 21. Creation of secret role and binding for webhook

I gave role access and created a rolebinding for the webhook (to bind gandi and the cert-manager).

```bash
kubectl create role access-secret --verb=get,list,watch,update,create --resource=secrets
```

Then i copied the webhook number with :

```Bash
k get secrets -n cert-manager
```

![webhook](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108001918/210821499-2c9231b6-05a8-4a2a-964b-11c8792a9dbd.png)

And pasted it on the following command :

```bash
kubectl create rolebinding --role=access-secret default-to-secrets --serviceaccount=cert-manager:cert-manager-webhook-gandi-1672931110
```
